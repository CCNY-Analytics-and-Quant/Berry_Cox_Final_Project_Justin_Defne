## The Requirements:
- Step 1: Choose an ETF with a minimum of 100 assets, identify those assets
- Step 2: Retrieve historical data for your chosen ETF
- Step 3: Calculate the price momentum factors for each asset in your ETF
- Step 4: Using the price momentum factors, calculate the monthly z-factor score for each asset
- Step 5: Identify long and short baskets (10 to 15 assets in each) using calculated z-factors
- Step 6: Create a backtest to validate performance of your algorithm based on monthly restructuring over the previous 5 years.
- Step 7: Chart:
  1. Monthly portfolio return bar chart (pos/neg coloring) vs ETF
  2. Monthly return for long picks vs short picks vs ETF
